# MyReads: Book Tracking App

A [React.js]() bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Installation and Launch

1. To install the application clone this git repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ibrahimkundlik/MyReadsApp.git MyReadsApp
```

2. Go into the application folder

```
$ cd MyReadsApp
```

3. Install dependencies using`npm` command line tool

```
$ npm install
```

4. Run the application, again using `npm`

```
$ npm start
```

**This will open a new browser tab/window with the application running on ```http://localhost:3000/```**

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
